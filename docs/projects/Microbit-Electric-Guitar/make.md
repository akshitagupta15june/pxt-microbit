# Lets Make an Electric Guitar using Microbit

A guitar is a plucked stringed musical instrument. Normally, the guitar is expensive, but here I have created a cheap and convenient DIY that can help you enjoy and play real chords on an electric micro: bit guitar. Enjoy micro: bit guitar by shifting the pitch up and down octaves.

### How it Works?


When you touch pin 1 or pin 2 and GND it will play a broken chord, but now you can move the chord down an octave (lowering its pitch) by pressing button A and move it up an octave (raising its pitch) by pressing button B.

The pitch (frequency) of a note doubles when you move up one octave: middle A has a frequency of 440Hz (440 vibrations per second), high A has a frequency of 880Hz. This is why making the vibrating part of guitar strings different lengths with your fingers changes the pitch of the note being played.

### How to make?

micro: bit and optional battery pack

4 crocodile clip leads

cardboard, scissors, glue, tin foil

headphones, buzzer, or powered speaker
